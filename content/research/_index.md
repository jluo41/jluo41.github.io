## Current Research Projects

### Large Sensor Foundation Models for Healthcare

Developing large sensor models for continuous glucose monitoring and investigating their applications in diabetes management. This work involves transformer-based architectures that can learn from sequential sensor data.

### Risk Prediction Models Using EHR Data

Creating machine learning approaches to identify prediabetes onset subtypes using electronic health record data. This research examines health disparities in EHR-based risk prediction models.

### Clinical Text Processing

Using cutting-edge natural language processing and deep learning methods to learn representations of clinical notes in both English and Chinese. Methods include BERT-like pretrained language models, linguistic fields representation, and knowledge graph embeddings.

### Behavioral Bias Study with EHR Data

Utilizing voluminous EHR data to discover behavioral biases and cognitive biases of both physicians and patients.

## Toolkits Developed

### recfldtkn
Conceptualizing human subjects as collections of time-stamped records with multi-modal values, this pipeline package transforms these records into AI datasets and trains various types of AI models. This versatile pipeline is designed for both training and inference, allowing for implementation on real-world business platforms.

### cctner
A model that automatically extracts body, symptom, disease, examination, and other clinical entities from Chinese clinical texts.

### ATol
A website-based and AI-supported annotation tool for collaborative annotation.

### nlptext
A toolkit for preprocessing large English and Chinese corpus data with annotation labels and linguistic field grain sequences.
