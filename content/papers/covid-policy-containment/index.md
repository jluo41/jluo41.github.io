##### Abstract

Public health interventions have been widely implemented to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, but their relative effectiveness remains unclear. This study quantifies the impact of various public activity intervention policies on COVID-19 transmission using comprehensive epidemiologic data from 145 countries. We analyze the effectiveness of different intervention strategies including lockdowns, social distancing measures, and restrictions on public gatherings. Our findings provide quantitative evidence on which interventions were most effective in reducing transmission rates, informing evidence-based policy decisions for pandemic response and future preparedness.
