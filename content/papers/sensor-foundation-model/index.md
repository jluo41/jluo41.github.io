##### Abstract

This paper introduces a large sensor foundation model pretrained on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data for diabetes management. The model leverages transformer architecture and is trained on extensive real-world CGM data to learn generalizable representations of glucose dynamics. The foundation model demonstrates strong performance across multiple diabetes management tasks including glucose prediction at different time horizons, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia risk assessment, and patient stratification. This work represents a significant advance in applying foundation model approaches to physiological sensor data for healthcare applications.
