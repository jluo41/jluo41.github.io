##### Abstract

This paper proposes Field Embedding, a unified grain-based framework for word representation in natural language processing. Traditional word embeddings typically operate at a single granularity level, but our approach captures semantic information at multiple linguistic grain sizes, including characters, subwords, words, and phrases. We demonstrate that this multi-granularity approach improves performance on various NLP tasks.
