##### Abstract

Racial disparities in COVID-19 vaccination represent a critical public health challenge. This study examines how socioeconomic privilege and political ideology are associated with these disparities. Using comprehensive county-level data from across the United States, we analyze vaccination rates across different racial groups while controlling for socioeconomic factors and political leanings. Our findings reveal that socioeconomic privilege and political ideology significantly moderate racial disparities in vaccination uptake, with important implications for public health interventions and vaccine equity efforts.
