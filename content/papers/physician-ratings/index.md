##### Abstract

This paper examines recency bias in online physician ratings by analyzing a large dataset of physician reviews. We find that recent reviews have a disproportionate influence on overall physician ratings, which can affect patient decision-making and physician reputation. Our findings have implications for how online rating platforms present physician information to consumers.
