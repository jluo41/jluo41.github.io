##### Abstract

This paper presents CGM-GPT, a transformer-based glucose prediction model that leverages continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data to predict glucose trajectories at different time horizons. The model is designed to support diabetes management by providing accurate predictions that can help patients and healthcare providers make informed decisions about insulin dosing and lifestyle modifications.
