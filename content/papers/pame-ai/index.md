##### Abstract

Patient messaging is a critical component of healthcare interventions, yet creating effective, personalized messages at scale remains challenging. This paper introduces PAME-AI (Patient Messaging Creation and Optimization using Agentic AI), a novel framework that automates the generation and optimization of patient messages using agentic AI. The system employs large language models combined with reinforcement learning to create contextually appropriate messages tailored to individual patient characteristics, preferences, and health conditions. We demonstrate that PAME-AI can generate messages that are comparable or superior to human-created messages in terms of clarity, persuasiveness, and patient engagement metrics.
